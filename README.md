# OSHunter
OSHunter is a lightweight Bash script designed to detect the operating system of a remote host by analyzing TTL (Time-To-Live) values from ICMP ping responses. It identifies whether a target system runs Windows, Linux, or macOS based on characteristic TTL ranges, providing quick reconnaissance for network administrators and security researchers.
